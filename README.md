# 💫About Me :

👋 Hi, I’m João Nogueira — Flutter developer passionate about building clean, scalable, and cross-platform applications.

🔧 I specialize in mobile, web, and desktop development using Flutter, with strong experience in:

•  Clean architecture & automated testing
•  CI/CD pipelines & scalable API integrations
•  Firebase, Azure DevOps, Riverpod, MobX, Patrol & Crashlytics
•  Publishing apps to stores & integrating native services

🚀 I’ve led technical projects in SaaS environments, including document management systems and industrial safety platforms used by thousands of users across Brazil and abroad.

🌱 My background in biology and environmental education shaped how I approach problems: with curiosity, empathy, and precision. I bring that mindset into every project I work on.

💬 I love collaborating with agile teams, contributing to product decisions, and sharing what I learn. You’ll find me writing about Flutter, architecture, and dev best practices on my technical blog.

Let’s build things that matter.
