:recycle:In career transition.

Hi! I am a former biology teacher making career transition to technology as a developer. My current study and work are focused on Java, Kotlin and Flutter for mobile development. I have academic experience in technical research and extension projects, which helped me to develop communicative skills, teamwork, collaboration, experience with event organization and project management, as well as conduct research, investigations, solving problems with continuous learning. I also have teaching experience with elementary, high school and higher school students. I am always willing to learn new technologies from both front-end and back-end. My current knowledge includes a bit of web, and C. I am open to working as a junior developer to grow in the area, especially if I can combine my experience in education with technology.
