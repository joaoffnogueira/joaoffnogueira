# About Me :

I am a Senior Software Engineer with a dual background in scientific research and technical leadership. My career is defined by applying the rigorous problem-solving methods of science to the architecture of robust, scalable software.

Currently, I specialize in the Flutter ecosystem, where I have transitioned from individual contribution to leading technical initiatives that drive business impact.

Core Highlights:

Technical Leadership: As a Lead Developer at Cesla, I architected and maintained SaaS platforms ("Hive" and "Horus") serving over 3,000 monthly active users. My work directly replaced manual industrial workflows with secure, digital ecosystems.

Architecture & DevOps: I don't just write code; I build systems. I have successfully implemented CI/CD pipelines (Azure DevOps), defined clean architecture standards, and led team mentorship programs to ensure code maintainability.

The Scientific Edge: My previous career as a researcher in Environmental Sciences equipped me with a unique ability to handle complex data, conduct deep root-cause analysis, and approach debugging with methodological precision.

My Mission: To bridge the gap between complex business requirements and elegant technical solutions. I am looking to bring my experience in agile leadership, risk management, and full-cycle development to teams building critical, high-availability software.
