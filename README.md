# üí´About Me :

As a software developer, I have experience in creating Flutter applications for various platforms, including Android, iOS, Desktop, and Web. My practical and adaptable approach allows me to effectively collaborate with agile remote teams, currently focusing on the development of software that complies with the security standards and regulations of the Brazilian industry.

In addition to my experience in technology, I also have a background as a biologist, environmental educator, and researcher. These academic experiences allow me to bring a unique perspective and a differentiated critical sense to software development.

I possess agility and solid programming, refactoring, and debugging skills, as well as a strong problem-solving and risk management capability. My passion for rewriting and removing code reflects my constant pursuit of efficiency and practicality. I strive to stay updated and constantly research and study, often bridging biology and education to software engineering.

In my free time, I enjoy playing on the PS5, listening to music (especially Florence + The Machine), and traveling, with Peru being one of my favorite destinations. I am eager to continue my professional development, sometimes associated with academic research, and contribute with my experience.
