# üí´About Me :

:man_technologist:Systems Analysis and Development graduate.

:computer:Developer at Codeminer42

:recycle:In career transition.

Hi there! I am Jo√£o (something like John in English), a former biology teacher making a career transition to technology as a developer.

My current study and work are focused on Ruby, but I have some experience with Java, Kotlin and Flutter for mobile development.

I have academic experience in technical research and extension projects, which helped me to develop communicative skills, teamwork, collaboration, experience with event organization and project management, as well as conduct research to solve problems with continuous learning.

I also have teaching experience with elementary, high school and university students. I am always willing to learn new technologies from both the front-end and back-end. My current knowledge includes a bit of web, and C.
